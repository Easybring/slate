# Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.










# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Event tracking

## Introduction
For event tracking we are using [mixpanel](http://www.mixpanel.com). Mixpanel is a tool that let us create user events and export data from them. Below you will find all the needed info to create `custom events`, `funnels` and `analyze data` based on your needs.

## Create an event (no coding)
Mixpanel tracks any movement of every user automatically. Those events are not displayed on Mixpanel dashboard unless you name the ones you like to appear.

### Set up tracking
On your mixpanel dashboard select your name from the top right and press `Set up tracking`.

### Select Platform
In the next screen select the platform you want:

### Select page
Type or select the page the event happens, to load it and name the event.

### Create an event
In the autotrack view, press `Create event`.

<img src="images/create-event.png">

And then select the button/link/image/text you want to track as `click`.<br/>
Select a `name`, this is the name will appear in your event list on mixpanel dashboard.<br/>
And press save.<br/>
And then exit

### Check that works
When you have saved the event and exited the autotrack mode, go back to your dashboard and select segmentation.

And then inside the dropdown menu you can find your event. <br/>
Select it and you see the data history in a graph below.

That's it! You just created your first event.









# Tasks

## Create an offer

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

This endpoint creates an offer (referred to the api as `job_action`) to a task.
